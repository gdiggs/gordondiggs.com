![Chocolate bread pudding with whipped cream on a plate](./pudding.jpg)

I love bread pudding. The past few years, I've ended up making it on New Year's Eve. Not because there is anything specifically tying bread pudding to New Year's Eve, but more because I often make [lasagna](https://github.com/gdiggs/lasagna) on Christmas Eve and serving bread pudding after lasagna feels just a bit _too_ heavy for me.

This recipe is based on one from Kitchen Daily, the original page for which does not exist anymore, but [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150503020144/http://www.kitchendaily.com/read/dessert-youre-craving-now-bread-pudding) is an archived version.

At the bottom, there is a variation to make this a chocolate bread pudding. Both are lovely. Either way, I like serving it with some fresh whipped cream.

## Ingredients

- 6 tbsps melted butter
- 320 grams challah or babka loaf, cubed
- 2 large eggs
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 3/4 cup milk
- 3/4 cup cream
- 1 tsp. cinnamon
- Pinch of nutmeg
- 1 tsp. vanilla
- Pinch of salt

## Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 350F.
1. Add cubed bread to a large bowl. Drizzle melted butter over mixture so that it evenly coats all the bread.
1. Spread bread mixture in a 8x8 pan.
1. In another bowl, combine eggs, sugar, milk, cream and spices. Whisk until combined.
1. Pour liquid over bread mixture. Make sure the liquid is absorbing all through the bread by pressing down lightly on the top of the mixture.
1. Let bread stand for 30 minutes before baking to ensure all the liquid have absorbed.
1. Bake for 45 minutes until golden brown and interior is at 170°F.

## To make chocolate bread pudding

- Add 1 tbsp natural cocoa powder to custard
